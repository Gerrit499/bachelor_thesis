其他科学家认为这些植物有毒，所以恐龙不太可能吃它们，即便现在树懒和其他动物例如鹦鹉（恐龙的后代）可以吃有毒的叶子或水果。,"Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.",greedy,"Other scientists believe these plants are poisonous, so dinosaurs wouldn't eat them, even if they could eat the poisonous leaves or fruits.",-13.7890625,1.6087941348355561,7.282329193264405,0.3899713299397344,0.7711168527603149,0.7325959205627441

一个在地球上重 200 磅（90公斤）的人，在木卫一上的重量约为 36 磅（16公斤）。因此重力理所当然地对你产生了较小的牵引力。,"A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.",greedy,A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kilograms) on the planet will have a weight of 36 pounds (16 kilograms) on the moon.

约三千年后，也就是在1610年，意大利的天文学家伽利略·伽利莱（Galileo Galilei）使用望远镜观测天体，发现金星具有着与月球一致的相位。,"About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.",greedy,"In 1610, astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the Sun, and discovered that the Sun's position was the same as that of the Moon.",-15.5625,1.580467340192809,28.190471507804123,0.5637998073698854,0.7861087918281555,0.8106595873832703
相变的发生是因为金星（或月球）只有面向太阳的一边被照到。金星的相变支持了哥白尼的理论，即行星围绕太阳旋转。,Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.,greedy,"The process of changing is due to the fact that the moon (or the sun) is only facing the sun. The moon's change of state supports the Copernican theory, that the planets revolve around the sun.",-27.796875,1.854672875990238,7.135298142122592,0.5946666666666668,0.7491608262062073,0.7385115623474121

在初期军事失利之后，埃塞尔雷德终于与奥拉夫达成协议，奥拉夫重返挪威试图夺回王位，但算不上成功。,"After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.",greedy,"After the initial defeat, Elred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to take the throne, but was unsuccessful.",-17.71875,1.7710499815918301,33.9829552520788,0.4860510380622838,0.8568172454833984,0.8416927456855774

世界上已知最早的书是用梵文写的。《奥义书》编撰完成后，梵文由于等级制度的原因逐渐消失。,"The earliest known book in the world was written in Sanskrit.

德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。英国军队从敦刻尔克撤退时失去了大部分重型武器和补给，元气大伤。,"Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.",greedy,"The German attack was called the ""Sea Lion"" operation.

但皇家海军还是比德国海军（“Kriegsmarine”）强得多，可以摧毁任何跨越英吉利海峡的入侵舰队。,But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could have destroyed any invasion fleet sent across the English Channel.,greedy,But the Royal Navy was much stronger than the German Navy (“Kriegsmarine”) and could destroy any invasion fleet across the English Channel.,-12.6640625,1.5045865534759246,65.83318047980455,0.9076129377912644,0.9336660504341125,0.8679420948028564
然而，很少有皇家海军舰艇在潜在的入侵路线附近驻扎，因为海军将领们担心舰艇会被德国的空袭击沉。,"However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.",greedy,"However, few Royal Navy ships are stationed in the vicinity of potential invasion routes, because the commanders fear that the ships will be sunk by German air attacks.",-23.078125,1.9714481660377086,23.1261689099984,0.5694058958025113,0.8813835978507996,0.860625147819519

意大利的主要目标是非洲国家。为了夺取这些国家，他们需要一个军队基地，以便军队可以驶穿地中海，入侵非洲。,"Italy's main goals were African countries.

为此，他们不得不将英国在埃及的基地和船舰撤出。除了采取这些行动，意大利的战舰本不应该有所行动。,"For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.

在战争开始时，它们大多在海面上航行，但随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现。,"In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.",greedy,"In the beginning, they were mostly on the water, but with the development of radar and the precision of the sonar, submarines were forced to sink to avoid being discovered.",-20.984375,1.7912242158499276,15.282070610708384,0.5068119891008174,0.8303425908088684,0.8323456048965454

15 世纪 80 年代，在黑斯廷斯勋爵（Lord Hastings）开始建造这座城堡的时候，这个国家还相对和平，只需要防御一小群四处游荡的抢掠者。,"In the 1480s, when its construction was begun by Lord Hastings, the country was relatively peaceful and defense was only required against small bands of roving marauders.",greedy,"In 1580s, the Duke of Hastings began building the castle when the country was still relatively peaceful, and only needed to defend a small number of wandering thieves.",-21.1875,1.8319063443347525,8.068220340240515,0.42497231450719825,0.8332269787788391,0.8429268002510071

亚历山大大帝原本提议重建这座神庙，但其提案遭到拒绝。随后，在亚历山大死后，该神庙于公元前 323 年得以重建。,"Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied.

神秘主义可以与其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜区分开来，因为它强调对独特意识状态的个人直接体验，特别是那些和平的、有洞察力的、幸福的、甚至是狂喜的意识状态。,"Mysticism can be distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship by its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a unique state of consciousness, particularly those of a peaceful, insightful, blissful, or even ecstatic character.",greedy,"Mysticism can be distinguished from other religions and beliefs by its emphasis on personal direct experience, especially those of peace, insight, joy, or even happiness.",-21.3125,1.9464663977274512,21.594421960206557,0.6059287620373592,0.8446257710456848,0.8211264610290527

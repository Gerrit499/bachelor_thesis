这是因为，当灯泡还有一部分与插座相连时，当你接触到插座内部或灯泡的金属底座时，电流会流入插座（灯泡金属底座的连接处），让你受到严重的电击。,This is because electricity flowing into the socket where the metallic part of bulb sits can give you a severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or the metal base of the bulb while it is still partly in the socket.,greedy,"This is because when the light bulb is still in its socket or metal housing, when you touch the metal housing or the light bulb, the current will flow into the socket (the metal housing is connected to the light bulb), causing you to be seriously injured.",-31.265625,1.8038395074058446,8.460008059515843,0.3486780459577668,0.801759660243988,0.8064083456993103

一些科学家认为，三角龙以苏铁为食，苏铁是白垩纪时期很常见的一种植物。,"Some scientists think Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant that was common in the Cretaceous.",greedy,Some scientists believe that the Triassic dolphin was a type of plant that was eaten by the dinosaurs.,-19.1875,2.3030610524093618,28.140173273071824,0.48643216080402,0.6859885454177856,0.5323180556297302

其他科学家认为这些植物有毒，所以恐龙不太可能吃它们，即便现在树懒和其他动物例如鹦鹉（恐龙的后代）可以吃有毒的叶子或水果。,"Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.",greedy,"Other scientists believe these plants are toxic, so dinosaurs probably wouldn't eat them, even though trees and other animals such as parrots (the dinosaurs' offspring) can eat toxic leaves or fruits.",-18.59375,1.5738204917053862,13.69605865334335,0.5763947590870668,0.7947799563407898,0.798313558101654
木卫一的重力会对我产生怎样的作用力？如果你站在木卫一表面，你的体重会比在地球上轻。,"How would Io's gravity pull on me?

一个在地球上重 200 磅（90公斤）的人，在木卫一上的重量约为 36 磅（16公斤）。因此重力理所当然地对你产生了较小的牵引力。,"A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.",greedy,"A person weighing 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth will exert a force of 36 pounds (16kg) on the moon.

约三千年后，也就是在1610年，意大利的天文学家伽利略·伽利莱（Galileo Galilei）使用望远镜观测天体，发现金星具有着与月球一致的相位。,"About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.",greedy,"Around three thousand years later, in 1610, Galileo Galilei, a Galileo, used a telescope to observe the stars, discovering that the Sun has the same period as the Moon.",-20.96875,1.711996539521986,34.20369926250025,0.7218489756296939,0.7693532705307007,0.7396904230117798
相变的发生是因为金星（或月球）只有面向太阳的一边被照到。金星的相变支持了哥白尼的理论，即行星围绕太阳旋转。,Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.,greedy,The change in the Sun's position is caused by the moon (or the planet) only being seen in one direction.

在初期军事失利之后，埃塞尔雷德终于与奥拉夫达成协议，奥拉夫重返挪威试图夺回王位，但算不上成功。,"After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.",greedy,"After initial defeat, Eyselred finally agreed to Olaf's terms, Olaf returned to Norway to try to regain his throne, but was not successful.",-25.328125,2.061967686013933,21.235919360606673,0.569439104617882,0.8292431831359863,0.8223025798797607

梵语是一种博大精深的语言，也是许多现代印度语的起源，就像拉丁语是法语和西班牙语等欧洲语言的起源一样。,"Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served to be the source for many modern Indian languages, just like Latin is the source for European languages like French and Spanish.",greedy,"Sanskrit is a very rich language, and is also the source of many modern Indian languages, like Latin is French and Spanish as well as English.",-13.609375,1.57404042609334,26.508643322526837,0.5780857569737116,0.8539561629295349,0.7924995422363281

德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。英国军队从敦刻尔克撤退时失去了大部分重型武器和补给，元气大伤。,"Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”. Most of the British Army's heavy weapons and supplies had been lost when it evacuated from Dunkirk, so the army was fairly weak.",greedy,"The German attack was called ""The Black Sea Attack"" and was designated as the ""Operation Sea-Swimming.

然而，很少有皇家海军舰艇在潜在的入侵路线附近驻扎，因为海军将领们担心舰艇会被德国的空袭击沉。,"However, very few Royal Navy ships were based near the likely invasion routes as the admirals were afraid they would be sunk by German air attack.",greedy,"However, there are very few Royal Navy ships in the vicinity of potential invasion routes, because the commanders of the fleet are worried that the ships will be sunk by German air attack.",-25.75,1.9692082904389714,29.263946665839534,0.597565157750343,0.8732348680496216,0.8481612205505371

意大利的主要目标是非洲国家。为了夺取这些国家，他们需要一个军队基地，以便军队可以驶穿地中海，入侵非洲。,"Italy's main goals were African countries.

为此，他们不得不将英国在埃及的基地和船舰撤出。除了采取这些行动，意大利的战舰本不应该有所行动。,"For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.

在战争开始时，它们大多在海面上航行，但随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现。,"In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.",greedy,"At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed in the water, but as radar and accuracy improved, submarines were forced to swim underwater to avoid detection.",-17.015625,1.6260613064940321,25.61963287487456,0.5265189356098448,0.8836265802383423,0.8513797521591187

这种理念是，所有欧洲国家必须设法阻止某个国家/地区独自变得强大，因此，各国政府为了保持平衡经常更换盟友。,"The concept was that all European nations had to seek to prevent one nation from becoming powerful, and thus national governments often changed their alliances in order to maintain the balance.",greedy,"This is a view that all European countries must try to prevent a country/region from becoming powerful, so that governments have to make sure that their balance is maintained by changing their allies.",-32.125,2.328896934574579,11.2289032173749,0.4230986445783133,0.8270438313484192,0.8082617521286011

亚历山大大帝原本提议重建这座神庙，但其提案遭到拒绝。随后，在亚历山大死后，该神庙于公元前 323 年得以重建。,"Alexander, as king, offered to pay to rebuild the temple, but his offer was denied.

在十九世纪和二十世纪很长一段时间，人们都认为新西兰的第一批居民是毛利人，他们猎取一种称为恐鸟的大型鸟类。,"For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people, who hunted giant birds called moas.",greedy,"In the 19th and 20th centuries, people thought that the first settlers of New Zealand were the Maori, who hunted large birds known as the ""kitnips"".",-21.078125,1.7958949412794916,23.061222423109186,0.5968907939351289,0.8507729768753052,0.7654211521148682
然后该理论确立了这样一种观点：毛利人从波利尼西亚乘“大船”迁移，并从莫里奥里人手中夺取了新西兰，建立了一个农业社会。,"The theory then established the idea that the Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a Great Fleet and took New Zealand from the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.",greedy,"The theory then developed: The people of Polynesia migrated to the islands of Maui, and from the Moriori took control of New Zealand, establishing a society of agriculture.",-27.34375,2.0938830697439617,10.72058492821602,0.5686579267468577,0.8181460499763489,0.7080138325691223

同样，挥手告别时，如果掌心向着挥手者自己（而不是向着要挥别的人），身处西班牙的英国游客可能会误以为这是请人回来的手势。,"Similarly, a British traveller in Spain may mistake a wave goodbye involving the palm facing the waver (rather than the person being waved at) as a gesture to come back.",greedy,"The same, if you are in Spain, you may mistake the gesture of farewell when you are in the UK for a gesture of farewell to the person you are asking for.",-35.6875,2.69478775038348,4.768981297470625,0.3109850978514573,0.6015414595603943,0.5959370136260986

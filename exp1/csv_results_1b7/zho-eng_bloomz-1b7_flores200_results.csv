其他科学家认为这些植物有毒，所以恐龙不太可能吃它们，即便现在树懒和其他动物例如鹦鹉（恐龙的后代）可以吃有毒的叶子或水果。,"Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous so it is unlikely that any dinosaur ate them, even though today the sloth and other animals like the parrot (a descendant of the dinosaurs) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.",greedy,"Other scientists say these plants are poisonous, so dinosaurs probably wouldn't eat them, even though now lizards and other animals like parrots (dinosaur's descendants) can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.",-12.1328125,1.317512828827389,30.595618379484268,0.6514706730412766,0.8464658856391907,0.866923987865448

一个在地球上重 200 磅（90公斤）的人，在木卫一上的重量约为 36 磅（16公斤）。因此重力理所当然地对你产生了较小的牵引力。,"A person who weighs 200 pounds (90kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16kg) on Io. So the gravity, of course, pulls less on you.",greedy,The weight of a person on the Moon is about 36 pounds (16kg).

约三千年后，也就是在1610年，意大利的天文学家伽利略·伽利莱（Galileo Galilei）使用望远镜观测天体，发现金星具有着与月球一致的相位。,"About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that Venus has phases, just as the moon does.",greedy,"About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe the moon, and found that Venus has phases the same as the moon.",-8.8984375,1.2718827853767314,65.48295819614466,0.9154512285023748,0.8999990224838257,0.8633629083633423
相变的发生是因为金星（或月球）只有面向太阳的一边被照到。金星的相变支持了哥白尼的理论，即行星围绕太阳旋转。,Phases happen because only the side of Venus (or of the Moon) facing the Sun is lighted. The phases of Venus supported the theory of Copernicus that the planets go around the Sun.,greedy,The change in the moon's position is caused by the fact that only one side of the moon is facing the sun.

在初期军事失利之后，埃塞尔雷德终于与奥拉夫达成协议，奥拉夫重返挪威试图夺回王位，但算不上成功。,"After initial military setbacks, Ethelred was able to agree to terms with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to gain his kingdom with mixed success.",greedy,"In the early stages of the battle, Ethelred finally reached an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to reclaim the throne, but failed.",-12.90625,1.4459260769665425,32.43564830635163,0.43621572340276316,0.8385440707206726,0.8141762614250183

德国将此次袭击的代号定为“海狮行动”。英国军队从敦刻尔克撤退时失去了大部分重型武器和补给，元气大伤。,"Germany code-named the attack “Operation Sealion”.

意大利的主要目标是非洲国家。为了夺取这些国家，他们需要一个军队基地，以便军队可以驶穿地中海，入侵非洲。,"Italy's main goals were African countries.

为此，他们不得不将英国在埃及的基地和船舰撤出。除了采取这些行动，意大利的战舰本不应该有所行动。,"For that, they had to get rid of British bases and ships in Egypt.

在战争开始时，它们大多在海面上航行，但随着雷达的发展和精确度的提高，潜艇被迫潜入水下以免被发现。,"In the beginning of the war they mostly travelled on top of the sea, but as radar began developing and becoming more accurate the submarines were forced to go under water to avoid being seen.",greedy,"In the beginning they mostly sailed on the sea, but as radar became more advanced and accurate, submarines were forced to sink to avoid detection.",-14.734375,1.608500565641823,25.394346820288394,0.5128373892539091,0.8595628142356873,0.8438013792037964
